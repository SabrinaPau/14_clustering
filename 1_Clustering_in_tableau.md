# Clustering in Tableau

Tableau has a built-in K-Means function. This is accessible via the Analytics pane.  

Cluster analysis partitions marks in the view into clusters, where the marks within each cluster are more similar to one another than they are to marks in other clusters.

# How to cluster in Tableau
1. Create view
2. Drag and drop Cluster from the **Analytics pane** into the view
3. Result:
- Tableau creates a Clusters group on Colour and colours the marks in your view by cluster
- Tableau assigns each mark in the view to one cluster
4. Customize your Clusters
